This isn't typical of any of my other MODs. This one will just contain this README with the code you will need to 
place in your theme's template_main.php file. This section of code you can place anywhere in the file where you 
want the stardate, local date, and local time to be displayed.

CODE:
<!-- Set UCIP Stardate and Local Server Time -->
<?php echo "Stardate: ". $this->settings->get_setting('sim_year') . date("m.d"); ?>
<br />
<?php echo "Date: ". date("M d, Y"); ?>
<br />
<?php echo "Time: ". date("g:i A T");?>

So, for instance you want it placed above the sub-navigation:
<!-- SUB NAVIGATION -->
<div class="nav-sub">
	<!-- Set UCIP Stardate and Local Server Time -->
	<?php echo "Stardate: ". $this->settings->get_setting('sim_year') . date("m.d"); ?>
	<br />
	<?php echo "Date: ". date("M d, Y"); ?>
	<br />
	<?php echo "Time: ". date("g:i A T");?>
	<?php echo $nav_sub;?>
</div>

At a later date and time, I MAY make this an option in the site settings to turn on/off.
