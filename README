+--------------------------------------------------------

The following MOD will alter your Nova installation to place stardate, local time, and local date to your theme.
To install this application you need to perform the following steps.

1. Upload application/config/hooks.php to your application/config folder of your Nova install replacing 
the existing one if you haven't already modified this file. If you already have changes in this file, it's best 
that you just take the contents of this file and add it into your existing hooks.php file.

2. Upload application/hooks/UCIP-Stardate-Hook.php to your application/hooks folder of your Nova install.

3. In any theme you want to add this MOD to add <?php echo $stardate;?> to where ever you want this to be displayed.
Display alterations will need to be made in the file you uploaded in step 2.

At a later date and time, I MAY make this an option in the site settings to turn on/off.
